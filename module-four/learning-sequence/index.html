                <h4>Student activity</h4>
                <p>Students setup "Healthy" default model of eye, then explore 3 different disease model scenarios and try to find solutions for the diseases found.</p>
                <p>Students are to work their way through the task sheets. Through group discussion and trial and error they are to come up with a solution for each eye disease.</p>
                <p>Students are required to setup their light, lens, and screen according to Task Sheet #1,2 and 3 provided, which are symbolic of Myopia/Hyperopia, a cateract and macular degeneration respectively:</p>

                <h4>Student activity</h4>
                <p>Students are presented with images, which are gradually revealed with an increasing grid of pixels (2x2, 3x3, 4x4 etc.). Students predict what the image is and note the resolution.</p>
                <p>Students working in pairs play a game where a student is required to guess a symbol and image that their partner has chosen using the koalastothemax application. This application allows them to create an image which is initially restricted to a low resolution which gradually increases.</p>
                <p>Students swap roles and repeat.</p>
                <p>Students reflect on their methods at solving the puzzle.</p>
                <p>The class then pools their data and analyse how they identified the symbols and images (i.e. identify edges, shapes, light/dark) and trends in the class data (i.e. more pixels allows for better distinction).</p>
                <p>Their findings are then related to human vision.</p>

                <p>See Cutout template.pdf, Template part 1.pdf and instructions for assembly.</p> <p>Students are encouraged to move the field of view over the pictures and see if they can identify the images hidden by the moving field of view cover.</p>
