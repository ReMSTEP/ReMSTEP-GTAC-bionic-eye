                <h4>Student activity</h4>
                <p>Students setup "Healthy" default model of eye, then explore 3 different disease model scenarios and try to find solutions for the diseases found.</p>
                <p>Students are to work their way through the task sheets. Through group discussion and trial and error they are to come up with a solution for each eye disease.</p>
                <p>Students are required to setup their light, lens, and screen according to Task Sheet #1,2 and 3 provided, which are symbolic of Myopia/Hyperopia, a cateract and macular degeneration respectively.</p>
                <p>First they are to identify their disease using the key chart.  Then, through group discussion, and trial and error they are to come up with a solution for each eye disease.  Finally, Students will perform some brief research into this disease and what sort of treatments, if any, exist.</p>
