        <p><span>Learning Outcome:</span> Students predict and evaluate how manipulating different components of the eye may lead to impairment of vision, and relate their findings to clinical conditions and their treatment.</p>

            <h3>Module summary</h3>
            <p>Students manipulate models of the eye to represent different disease states, and then work together to find solutions to the challenges to sight that are produced by each disease state.</p>

                <li>Students manipulate their representations of the eye to explore a series of ‘what if’ statements to determine the effect on vision</li>
                <li>Students use a classification key to diagnose different visual impairments</li>
                <li>Students research current technologies to determine current treatments for conditions and realise the importance of STEM endeavours in treating vision impairment</li>
