    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <section class="outcome">
        <p><span>Learning Outcome:</span> Students implement the principles of energy conversion to demonstrate the sequence of events leading to the perception of the image on the retina by the brain.</p>
    </section>

            <h3>Module summary</h3>
            <p>Students gain insight into how light energy is transformed into chemical energy by retinal cells (rods and cones) and how the brain uses the signals from these cells to form a perceived image.</p>

            <h3>Design descriptors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students complete an activity that explores the idea that resolution is an important aspect of visual acuity.</li>
                <li>Students explore how a moving field of view can assist in constructing a representation of a static image in the brain through an identification game (to demonstrate that the visual cortex takes many pieces of information and collates them into a meaningful image)</li>
                <li>Students watch a video to support their understanding of the biochemistry of signal transduction in the eye and the role of the visual cortex in organisation and interpretation of stimulus information.</li>
