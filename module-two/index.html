        <p><span>Learning Outcome:</span> Students construct a representation of the human eye to illustrate how an image is produced on the retina.</p>

            <h3>Module summary</h3>
            <p>Students explore the ‘science of seeing’, through challenges to their pre-existing understandings and through analysis of the components of the human eye. Students will interact with models, perform a dissection of a cow’s eye (real or virtual) and construct a representation of the human eye to investigate how light produces an image on the retina.</p>

                <li>Students complete a quiz to identify any misconceptions related to light and seeing.</li>
                <li>Students complete a range of investigations to challenge common misconceptions.</li>
                <li>Students use a model to explore how an image is constructed on the retina using a lens system.</li>
                <li>Students dissect a cows eye (virtually or in the lab) to learn the components of the eye.</li>
                <li>Students construct a representation of the eye to demonstrate how optics focus an image on the retina.</li>

                <h3>Misconceptions (common, not exhaustive)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Light just exists and has no origin.</li>
                    <li>You can see in the dark.</li>
                    <li>Light does not need to enter the eye for vision of objects to occur (i.e. light only needs to illuminate an object).</li>
                    <li>Sight is an active process where something leaves the eyes (i.e. feeling a stare).</li>
                    <li>Objects emit light (as opposed to reflecting light).</li>
                    <li>Objects do not reflect light (light remains with the object).</li>
                    <li>Light only travels short distances or not at all.</li>
                    <li>Light can only be reflected off shiny surfaces.</li>
