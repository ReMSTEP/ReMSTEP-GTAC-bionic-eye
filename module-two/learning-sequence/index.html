                <h4>Teacher activity</h4>
                <p>Ask students to reflect on the eye model setup in which the lens produced an inverted shadow of a pen on the screen.  Ask students to represent their understanding of what was happening there using an illustration or http://www.sketchtoy.com</p>

                <p>Ask students to write and draw an illustrated summary for this learning goal: Explain how an image is formed on the retina by a convex lens using ray diagrams. – They can do this on paper or using http://www.sketchtoy.com</p>
                <p>Teacher works with students to negotiate what is happening and supports students in producing representations of how an image is formed on the retina by a convex lens using ray diagrams.</p>

                <p>Students draw their initial representations of what is happening when an image is inverted by a lens. They can do this on paper or using http://www.sketchtoy.com</p>
                <p>Students manipulate a digital representation of the model used in the modelling activity.</p>
                <p>Students freely manipulate model, inviting ‘discovery’ learning.</p> 
                <p>Students consider questions posed and how model may be manipulated to test this.</p>
                <p>Students make predictions on what will occur when they manipulate model and undertake manipulations.</p>
                <p>Students observe findings and contextualise these to ray diagrams which they use to create a representation of how an image is formed on the retina by a convex lens.</p> 
                <p>Through feedback about these representations from teachers and other peers, students modify their representations to demonstrate their understandings.</p>
