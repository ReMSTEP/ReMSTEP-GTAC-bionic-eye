            <h3>Science / Level 9 / Science as a Human Endeavour / Use and influence of science</h3>
            <p>People use scientific knowledge to evaluate whether they should accept claims, explanations or predictions (<a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/129125/20121206-0015/ausvels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/ACSHE160">ACSHE160</a>).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students make predictions, observations and explain inconsistencies between what they used to understand and their developing scientific understandings</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="one-third well">
            <h3>Science / Level 9 / Science Inquiry Skills / Questioning and predicting</h3>
            <p>Formulate questions or hypotheses that can be investigated scientifically (<a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/129125/20121206-0015/ausvels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/ACSIS164">ACSIS164</a>).</p>

            <h3>Science / Level 9 / Science Inquiry Skills / Planning and conducting</h3>
            <p>Select and use appropriate equipment, including digital technologies, to systemically and accurately collect and record data (<a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/129125/20121206-0015/ausvels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/ACSIS166">ACSIS166</a>).</p>

            <h3>Science / Level 9 / Science Inquiry Skills / Processing and analysing data and information</h3>
            <p>Analyse patterns and trends in data, including describing relationships between variables and identifying inconsistencies (<a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/129125/20121206-0015/ausvels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/ACSIS169">ACSIS169</a>). Use knowledge of scientific concepts to draw conclusions that are consistent with evidence (<a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/129125/20121206-0015/ausvels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/ACSIS170">ACSIS170</a>).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Students manipulate computer simulations in order to analyse the relationships between different variables and use their observations to draw conclusions about how systems work.</li>

        <section class="one-third well">
            <h3>Science / Level 9 / Science Inquiry Skills / Evaluating</h3>
            <p>Critically analyse the validity of information in secondary sources and evaluate the approaches used to solve problems (<a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/129125/20121206-0015/ausvels.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Curriculum/ContentDescription/ACSIS172">ACSIS172</a>).</p>
