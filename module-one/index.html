            <h3>Module summary</h3>
            <p>Students gain an awareness of vision impairment through first-hand experience. They attempt a series of everyday tasks with their normal vision and while wearing vision-impairing goggles. Students record the amount of time taken to perform each task, with and without impaired vision, and collate data to determine the most difficult tasks of those encountered. Students reflect upon how impaired vision impacts upon participation in society.</p>

            <h3>Design descriptors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Students brainstorm to construct a class representation of the challenges that face visually impaired citizens.</li>
                <li>Students experience a series of visual impairment experiences that provide an awareness of the challenges encountered when vision is impaired. They record time taken to complete each task.</li>
                <li>Students collate class results to determine the tasks that are most difficult to complete if vision is impaired and then compare to video footage of visually impaired citizens.</li>
                <li>Of the challenges faced, students identify how other senses can compensate for the loss of vision.</li>
