                <p>Explain homework jigsaw box plot task. Assign groups to produce plots for the challenge stations, and students who will complete each box and whisker plot that represents control, Macular Degeneration and Retinitis Pigmentosa data for each challenge station.  Each student from each challenge station MUST use the same scale on their number lines to represent their data so that their box and whisker plots can be compared in parallel during the next class.</p>

                <p>Students record results as they perform tasks to station data sheets.</p>
                <p>Before moving between stations students should reflect on the difficulties they encountered, the possible ways to overcome them and consider what other senses compensated for the loss of vision at their current station (the challenge station descriptions include questions for reflecting in this way).</p>
                <p>On the challenge stations that students finish on, students are told they will need to produce box plots that represent the class data for either the control, Macular Degeneration or Retinitis Pigmentosa data. The data from all of the challenge stations will be represented as box plots.  This is a homework task.</p>
